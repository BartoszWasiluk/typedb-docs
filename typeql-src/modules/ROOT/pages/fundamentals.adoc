:summary: TypeQL essentials

All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.

TypeQL is *declarative* query language.
Rather than writing an algorithm of how the data should be retrieved, we declare requirements and the TypeDB query
processor will take care of finding an optimal way to retrieve and process the data.

[NOTE]
====
TypeQL is both a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language[Data Definition Language,window=_blank] (DDL)
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language[Data Manipulation Language,window=_blank] (DML).
====

As a DDL, it lets us define a <<_schema,schema>> of a database.

As a DML, it lets us query (read&write) <<_data,data>> of a database.

The complete set of the TypeQL grammar can be seen in the *ANTLR v.4* specification file:
https://github.com/vaticle/typeql/blob/master/grammar/TypeQL.g4[TypeQL.g4,window=_blank].

== Query structure

A TypeQL xref:queries.adoc[query] consists of clauses: `define`, `undefine`, `match`, `get`, `insert`, `delete`.

The `get` clause starts with the `get` keyword, followed by a list of variables and optional modifiers at the end.

All other TypeQL clauses consist of the defining keyword (the same as the name of the clause) and a pattern.

*** Pattern
**** Statement

and the xref:typeql::data/advanced.adoc[] pages.

[#_schema]
== Schema

TypeDB schema is like a blueprint of a database.

A database schema contains all user-defined <<_types,types>> and <<_rules,rules>> used in a database.

Every instance of data inserted in a TypeDB database must be assigned a type and be validated against constraints.

[#_types]
=== Types
// tag::types_basics[]
A type represents a set of constraints on the interpretation of data.

A type for a data instance is like a class for an object in OOP.

A definition of a type in a schema of a database sets:

* type hierarchy -- every user-defined type has only one parent or supertype.
* constraints -- what a type can do: what role to play, what attributes it can own, what value type it has
(attribute types only), and what roles it relates (relation types only).

A type can be addressed by its label (name). A type label is unique in a schema of a database.

We can define a new type only as a subtype of an existing one.

A new empty database has a set of built-in types. These built-in types called root types, because all user defined
types will be subtypes (direct or non-direct) of those root types.

.Root (built-in) types
[cols="^.^1, ^.^3, ^.^4",options="header"]
|===
| Root type label | A subtype of the root type | An instance of data of a subtype

| `entity`
| Entity type
| Instance of entity type

| `relation`
| Relation type
| Instance of relation type

| `attribute`
| Attribute type
| Instance of attribute type

// | `role`
// | `role`
// | N/A
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
All root types are <<_abstract_types,abstract>> types.

That's why when we say *entity type* we usually mean a subtype of the `entity` root type.
In the same way we can address *relation type* or *attribute type* instead of mentioning
subtypes of the root types.
====
// end::types_basics[]

[NOTE]
====
To avoid ambiguity when using type labels we should try to provide context or specify what exactly
we mean:

- the type and all its subtypes (the default variant),
- the exact type, without any of its subtypes,
- or instances of data of this particular type, and instances of data of all its subtypes.
====

////
TypeDB schemas resemble logical data models of relational databases.
TypeDB removing the need to create a separate physical data model and allowing developers to create schemas that
mirror their object model simplifying both design and development.

As a result, TypeDB schemas look like entity-relationship (ER) diagrams. With entities, relations, and attributes
connected by roles of relations, and ownerships of attributes, but also subtyping (see <<_inheritance,inheritance>>
below).
////

[#_inheritance]
=== Inheritance
// tag::inheritance_basics[]

A type can subtype another type. As a result, the subtype inherits all the attributes owned and roles played by its
supertype.

[NOTE]
====
Roles can be inherited and even overridden as a part of relation inheritance.
====

Type can only have a single supertype.

Types can be subtypes of other subtypes, resulting in a type hierarchy.

.See simple example
[%collapsible]
====
For example, `business unit` subtypes `user group`, which subtypes `subject`, which subtypes `entity` root type.
Also `person` subtypes `user`, that subtypes `subject`:

* entity
** subject
*** user group
**** business unit
*** user
**** person
====

There is a strict hierarchy of types, so the whole typing system of a TypeDB database always can be represented
by three independent trees with one of the root types at the top of each tree.

.See hierarchy trees example
[%collapsible]
====
For example, a schema with the following types:

* entity
** person
** vehicle
*** car
*** motorcycle
*** bicycle

* relation
** owning
** using
*** driving
*** traveling

* attribute
** model
** name
*** full-name
*** nickname

can be visualized as following type hierarchy:

image::root-types-trees.png[]
====
// end::inheritance_basics[]

[#_abstract_types]
== Abstract types
// tag::abstract_basics[]

All root types are abstract types.

An abstract type can't be instantiated (we can't insert an instance of data of this type). All we can do with an
abstract type is to subtype it.

The opposite of an abstract type is a concrete type. All types are concrete by default.
// end::abstract_basics[]

[#_thing_type]
=== Thing type
// tag::thing_type_basics[]

There is an internal type called `thing` that can be used to address all types
(both built-in and user-defined) or instances of all types (effectively â€” all data).

All other types are subtypes of the `thing`.

image::thing-era-role-rule.png[Types hierarchy]

// #todo Redraw the diagram. Without the Thing. Consider using PlantUML

[WARNING]
====
The `thing` built-in type will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB version 3.0.

[#_entity_types]
=== Entity types
// tag::entity_type_basics[]

*Entity types* (or subtypes of the `entity` root type) represent the classification of independent objects in the
data model of our business domain.

Instance of data of an entity type represents a standalone object that exists in our data model independently.

Instance of an entity type doesn't have a value.
It is usually addressed by its ownership over attribute instances and/or roles played in relation instances.

An object modeled with an entity type might practically require other entities to exist, such as a car that cannot
exist without its parts, but can be conceptualized without reference to those other entities: a car can be imagined
without considering its parts.

// end::entity_type_basics[]

.See example
[%collapsible]
====
Given the schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;

person sub entity,
  owns name,
  playes spouce:marriage;

marriage sub relation,
  relates spouse;
----

An instance of the `person` type can be inserted in a database:

* without owning any instances of the `name` attribute type, nor playing any roles,
* owning exactly one instance of the `name` attribute type with some value and playing a role of a spouse in a marriage
  relation,
* owning multiple names and/or playing a role of spouse in multiple instances of the `marriage` relation type.
====
//#todo Improve the example

To define a new entity type we need to set its label and what type it's a subtype of.

To set a property of an entity (like a name of a person) we need to define ownership by this entity of an instance
of an `attribute` type with the required value.

To define a relationship between an entity and some other user-defined types we need to define a relation with roles,
as well as define the ability of the involved types to play those roles.

.Entity types and instances example
[%collapsible]
====
For example, there could be entity types like `company` and `person`.

Given the `company` entity type defined in a database schema, we can insert instances of data of this type in such
a database. Every instance of the `company` type inserted into the database will represent a company, that can be
addressed by whatever attributes it has (e.g., name, registration number), or by roles played in relations (e.g.,
`employer` for the particular instance of `person` entity type in an `employment` relation type).

image::instances-example.png[]

On the above image two instances of `company` type are called `Company #1` and `Company #2`, while in real life
scenario in a TypeDB database there is almost no way to differentiate between those two instances if they have no
attributes and do not participate in any relations. The only information we can get from existence of two instances
is that there are two distinct objects. But its really hard to tell which one is which without any additional
related data inserted.
====

For more information on how to define an `entity` type see the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc#_define_entity_types[Define entity types] section on the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc[] page.

=== Relation types
// tag::relation_type_basics[]

Relation types (or subtypes of the `relation` root type) represent relationships between types.
Relation types have roles.

Other types can play roles in relations if it's mentioned in their definition. Instance of other
type can be a role player for a role in the instance of a relation.

An instance of a relation can be uniquely addressed by a combination of its type, owned attributes, and role players.

A `relation` type must specify at least one role. A relation cannot be conceptualized without at least some of its
role players.

// end::relation_type_basics[]

// tag::relation_type_examples[]

.See group-membership example
[%collapsible]
====
For example, given the schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

group-membership sub relation,
  relates user-group,
  relates group-member;

user-group sub entity
  plays group-membership:user-group;

subject sub entity,
  plays group-membership:group-member;
user sub subject;
----

`group-membership` is a `relation` type that defines `user-group` and `group-member` roles.
The `user-group` role is to be played by a `user-group` entity type whereas the `group-member` role is to be played by
a `subject` type and all its subtypes entities.
====

Roles allow a schema to enforce logical constraints on types of role players.

.See example of a role type constraint
[%collapsible]
====
For example, a `group-membership` relation cannot associate a `user` type entity with a `file` type entity, because
`file` type entity can't play any role in a `group-membership` relation.
====

// end::relation_type_examples[]

[NOTE]
====
Roles can be used in queries as a part of a relation even though roles do not have a direct type definition.
====

////
.See example
[%collapsible]
====
Given the schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;

person sub entity,
  owns name,
  playes spouce:marriage;

marriage sub relation,
  relates spouse;
----

An instance of a `marriage` relation type can be addressed by the instances of the `person` entity type that play the
role of spouses.

It is impossible to imagine a marriage without considering its spouses.
====
//#todo Improve the example
////

For more
information on how to define a `relation` subtype see the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc#_define_relation_types[Define relation types] section on the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc[] page.

[#_attribute_types]
=== Attribute types
// tag::attribute_type_basics[]

Attribute types (or subtypes of the `attribute` root type) represent properties that can be owned by other types.

Attribute types have a value type and instances of attribute types have a value.
This value is fixed and unique for every given instance of the attribute type.

Other types can own an attribute type.
That means that instances of these other types can own an instance of this attribute type.
Which is usually means that an object in our domain have a property with the matching value.

An instance of an attribute type can be uniquely addressed by its type and value.

There can't be a second instance of the same type with the same value.

Multiple types can own the same attribute type -- and different instances of the same type or different types can
share ownership of the same attribute instance.

// end::attribute_type_basics[]

For more information on the types of values that attributes can have: see the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc#_value_types[list of value types] on the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc[] page.

// tag::attribute_type_example[]

.See example
[%collapsible]
====
Given the schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;

person sub entity,
  owns name;
----

An instance of an attribute type `name` with a value "Bob" can be owned by:

* no one (no instance of the `person` type owns the instance of the `name` type with value "Bob"),
* one particular person (there is one person with such a name),
* or multiple people (there are multiple people with name `Bob`. All of the `pesron` type instances have ownership of
  the same instance of the `name` type with the value "Bob").
====
// end::attribute_type_example[]

// tag::attribute_type_own_depr[]
[WARNING]
====
The feature of an attribute type owning another attribute type will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and
deleted in TypeDB version 3.0.
====
// end::attribute_type_own_depr[]

For more information on how to define an `attribute` subtype see the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc#_define_attribute_types[Define attribute types] section on the
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc[] page.

[#_rules]
=== Rules
// tag::rules_basics[]

Rules are a part of schema and define embedded logic.

The reasoning engine uses rules as a set of logic to infer new data.

Rules can dramatically shorten complex queries, perform xref:typedb::dev/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explainable]
knowledge discovery, and implement business logic at the database level.

A rule consists of a *condition* and a *conclusion*.

A *condition* is a pattern to look for in data.

A *conclusion* is a pattern to insert virtual (inferred) data for every result matched with a pattern from *condition*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Inference can only be used in a read transaction.

Rules can't change persisted data in a database.

All reasoning is done within a dataset of a transaction.
====

The rules syntax uses `when` and `then` keywords for condition and conclusion respectively.

.Rule syntax
[,typeql]
----
rule rule-label:
when {
    ## the condition
} then {
    ## the conclusion
};
----

The conclusion can be used to create a single virtual instance of data: a relation or ownership of an attribute.

Rules are used by queries for xref:typedb:ROOT:dev/infer.adoc[Inferring new data] only in read transactions,
and only if the inference option is enabled.

// end::rules_basics[]

.See an example of a rule
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
rule add-view-permission: when {
    $modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
    $view isa action, has name "view_file";
    $ac_modify (object: $obj, action: $modify) isa access;
    $ac_view (object: $obj, action: $view) isa access;
    (subject: $subj, access: $ac_modify) isa permission;
} then {
    (subject: $subj, access: $ac_view) isa permission;
};
----
====

We can use xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_computation[computation] operations and functions in the condition pattern.
And we can use value variables in the conclusion of a rule.

[WARNING]
====
It is possible to create a recursive logic in the line of `n = n +1` by assigning an attribute ownership with value of
value variable. Such a rule, if triggered can run indefinitely, while transaction lasts and can cause an out of memory
error.
====

For more information on how to create rules in a schema see the xref:typeql::schema/def-rule.adoc[] page.

[#_data]
== Data

Every piece of data stored in a TypeDB database must be an instance of a <<_types,type>>,
xref:typeql::schema/def-type.adoc[defined] in the schema of the database.

In other words, to insert a data into a TypeDB database we must use the types, defined in the schema of the database.

The schema defines the vocabulary we use to query our data. See <<_data_example,example>> below.

For more information about reading and writing data, see the following pages:

* Writing data:
** xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[]
** xref:typeql::data/delete.adoc[]
** xref:typeql::data/update.adoc[]
* Reading data:
** xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[]

[#_data_example]
=== Example

Given the following schema:
[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
  owns name,
  owns age,
  owns certified-future-teller;

name sub attribute, value string;
age sub attribute, value long;
certified-future-teller sub attribute, value boolean;
----

The simplest xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[insert query] can look like this:

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person;
----

But what is the use of an empty entity without any attributes owned or roles played in relations?

More useful example of insert query can look as the following:

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-future-teller false;
----

Now to read that data we can use the xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[get] query:

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person;
----

This should return us all instances of the `person` type. But yet again -- what is the use for entities without their
properties? Let's query for all attributes owned by the `person` type instances:

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has $a;
----

This should return us the `Bob` of age `31`.

[NOTE]
====
The result of the above query will not return us the
first instance of `person` type we inserted, because it has no attributes, hence doesn't fit in the `match` clause
pattern. Specifically, it doesn't match the `has $a` part.
====
