== Overview

Using a TypeDB Client is the primary way to interact with a TypeDB server. These include standalone applications
as well as lower-level libraries called Drivers.

All Clients use a network `grpc` https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[protocol,window=_blank] under the hood
to communicate with a TypeDB server.

//#todo putting protocol versioning as a 'WARNING' is off-putting - we can frame it as a good thing!
[IMPORTANT]
====
All TypeDB Clients validate compatibility with the TypeDB server when establishing a connection.

This is done using xref:typedb::dev/connect.adoc#_protocol_version[protocol versioning], and
ensures that the client cannot send or receive unexpected data from the server.
====

== Standalone applications

To work with TypeDB databases we can use one of the standalone software tools developed by Vaticle:

. xref:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] -- IDE with GUI and TypeQL syntax highlighting.
. xref:console.adoc[TypeDB Console] -- powerful CLI tool.

Both tools are complete software products that can be used to connect to TypeDB and interact with it. They manage
connections, sessions and transactions, as well as submitting queries and reading back the responses.

//#todo is this "important"? Or more of "note"?
[IMPORTANT]
====
User-friendly standalone applications also use a lower-level Driver to handle communication with the server.

For example, both TypeDB Studio and TypeDB Console are built on top of the Java TypeDB Driver.

== TypeDB Drivers

A TypeDB Driver is a library that implements https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Client RPC,window=_blank]
protocol. TypeDB Drivers are available for some of the most popular programming languages, allowing you to
build applications that connect to a TypeDB database easily.

The following TypeDB Drivers are officially supported and actively maintained by Vaticle. They
support the latest TypeDB features and receive continuous bug fixes and improvements.

* xref:java/java-overview.adoc[Java]
* xref:node-js/node-js-overview.adoc[Node.js]
* xref:python/python-overview.adoc[Python]
* Rust (https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-client-rust[Under development,window=_blank])

There are also xref:other-languages.adoc[community-developed clients]
(including a https://pypi.org/project/typedb-jupyter/[Jupyter connector,window=_blank])
and guides for creating xref:new-driver.adoc[new drivers].

=== Architecture of a TypeDB Driver

All TypeDB Drivers share a common architecture and capabilities. The core components have to do with opening and managing
connections, sessions, and transactions, as well as submitting queries and processing responses.

//#todo Redraw in new design

Drivers also do some local query validation, load-balancing (TypeDB Cloud only) and authentication (TypeDB Cloud only).

The Driver APIs document the full set of components and capabilities:
* xref:java/java-api-ref.adoc[Java Driver API reference],
* xref:python/python-api-ref.adoc[Python Driver API reference],
* xref:node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc[Node.js Driver API reference].
