== Instantiating a TypeDB Core client

=== Syntax

[source,java]
----
TypeDB.coreClient(String address, int parallelisation);
----

=== Description

In order to communicate with TypeDB Core databases via sessions and transactions, we first need to instantiate a
TypeDB Core client.
The created object connects our application with the running TypeDB Server.

=== Input parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description |Type |Required |Default Value
| address | The address (host:port) on which the TypeDB Server is running | String | True |  
| parallelisation | The number of threads to use for server communication | int | False | Scales based on host machine's number of available CPU cores
|===

=== Returns

* <<_client_methods,Client>>

== Instantiating a TypeDB Cluster client

=== Syntax

[source,java]
----
TypeDB.clusterClient(Set<String> addresses, TypeDBCredential credential, int parallelisation);
----

=== Description

In order to communicate with TypeDB Cluster databases via sessions and transactions, we first need to instantiate a
TypeDB Cluster client. The created object connects our application with the running TypeDB Cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Node.js and Python Drivers always have TLS enabled!

They can only connect to a server that is set up with TLS.
====

When instantiating a TypeDB Cluster client, it is sufficient to supply the address of just one server, as the addresses
of the other servers will be relayed back to the client. However, to avoid failure in the unlikely event that the
single server whose address is provided fails before communicating the addresses of the others, it is best practice to
supply addresses of all the servers.

=== Input parameters

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description |Type |Required |Default Value
| addresses | Addresses (host:port) on which TypeDB Cluster nodes are running | Set of String | True |  
| credential | User credential and TLS encryption setting | TypeDBCredential | True |  
| parallelisation | The number of threads to use for server communication | int | False | Scales based on host machine's number of available CPU cores

=== Returns

* <<_client_methods,Client>>
