== Summary

TypeDB:

* Is a strongly typed database that is unique in many ways:
 ** has its own special xref:02-dev/schema.adoc[static type system],
 ** uses xref:02-dev/schema.adoc#_entity_types[Entity-Relationship model], extended with
xref:02-dev/schema.adoc#_attribute_types[Attributes] and xref:02-dev/schema.adoc#_rules[Rules],
// - #todo add link to the types article
 ** supports subtyping and inheritance like OOP languages,
 ** uses declarative queries with its own query language: xref:02-dev/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[TypeQL]. We set the
requirements for results but not how to achieve it.
* Is a transactional (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing[OLTP]) DBMS with
xref:02-dev/connect.adoc#_acid_guarantees[ACID] guarantees.
* Has data separated by xref:02-dev/connect.adoc#_databases[databases], each one with its own
xref:02-dev/schema.adoc[schema].

== Introduction

TypeDB is a new kind of DBMS:

* not an SQL, but uses enhanced Entity-Relationship model, further extended by attributes as first-class citizens;
* not a graph database, but utilizes power of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph[hypergraphs] without the
  need for developers to understand how it works to use it.

TypeDB guarantees data integrity and safety while enabling data-level inferences within the database.
Strong type system with subtyping and inheritance helps us break down complex problems into a
meaningful and logical data models. TypeDB uses its own declarative query language, TypeQL, that gives powerful
abstraction over implementation of storage, to enable us to use complex data patterns and reasoning engine.

With TypeQL we describe data that we need by xref:02-dev/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[patterns],
consisting of constraints. TypeDB will use those patterns to retrieve all data, that satisfies all the constraints,
in the most efficient way. We don't have to think about query optimization, limitations of data storage
implementation, etc.

By combining TypeQL and TypeDB, we can close the gap between the language of our domain, and what the
database can interpret and respond to. Queries written in TypeQL are humanely readable. Carefully designed database
xref:02-dev/schema.adoc#_types[schema] lets us use terminology of the business domain we are modelling.
Making our queries sounding familiar for subject-matter experts. This new paradigm gives a higher level of
flexibility and expressivity to simplify our work and tackle domains that seemed impossibly complex before.

TypeQL and TypeDB allow us to build a data model out of entity, relation, and attribute types. Inheritance allows
subtypes to be defined simply and reduce complexity, while roles and rules further enhance our schema. These
abstractions provide a higher-level framework to build intuitive and understandable models.

// We can use the power of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph[hypergraphs] without the need to understand graphs!

In other databases, relations may be implemented with a join table (SQL), or an edge between two vertices
(graph databases). TypeDB relations generalize both: they flexibly relate one, two, or any number of data instances
at the same time.

This expanded idea of a relation is more powerful than either SQL or graph relations. However, we can further
improve this idea: if we allow relations to not just specify which instances relate to each other, but also _how_
they relate by adding context. This has been implemented in the form of a role. Any relation type specifies one or many
roles that are related by this relation. Any type in a schema can play roles that were specifically defined in the type
definition.

Finally, we can use reasoning engine to infer new data based on the patterns found in database. To be able to do that
we define rules in the database schema. Rules can dramatically shorten complex queries (e.g., transitivity of
relations), perform xref::02-dev/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explainable] knowledge discovery, and implement business
logic at the database level.

== Learn more

1. First things first -- use xref::01-start/installation.adoc[installation guide] to install TypeDB on the
   local machine.

2. We strongly recommend starting TypeDB journey with our xref::01-start/quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide].
   It goes through the step-by-step process of creating a new database, applying schema, loading sample data,
   and querying. The resulting environment is suitable for executing most examples in our documentation.
   On top of that it familiarizes users with TypeDB Studio â€” IDE, specifically designed for TypeDB
   database management and development.
