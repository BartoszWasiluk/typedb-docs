TypeDB xref:fun/queries.adoc[queries] are written in xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] and use *patterns* to
manipulate the schema and data of a database.

[#_patterns_overview]
//== Patterns overview

A pattern consists of statements.

Every statement ends with a semicolon and consists of:

* variables,
* keywords,
* types,
* values.

TypeQL statements constitute the smallest meaningful building blocks of queries.
Please find below a closer look at the typical statement structure.

[#_statement-structure]
image::statement-structure.png[Statement structure]

* A TypeQL variable is prefixed with a dollar sign `$` (for concept variable) or a question mark `?` (for value
variables).
+
Most statements start with a variable (marked with `V` on the image above) providing a
reference to a concept or value (one per every solution found). For more information on variables
see the <<_variables,Variables>> section.
* A variable is followed by a comma-separated list of constraints (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) describing the concepts the
variable refers to.
* The end of the statement is marked with a semicolon (`;`).

====
A pattern can be thought of as a system of equations, where every equation is a single statement.

TypeDB will solve the system to find all solutions. Every solution includes a concept (type or instance of data)
for every concept variable and value for every value variable.
====

[#_solutions]
It's important to understand that the *result* of a `match` clause with any pattern is a *set of solutions found*.
The length of the set is equal to the number of solutions found, hence it can be:

* Zero -- No solutions found (nothing matched the pattern). Empty set returned.
* One -- Exactly one solution found and returned in a set.
* Many -- Multiple solutions found, including all possible permutations. All of them returned in a set.

For example, in the <<_statement-structure,statement>> illustrated above TypeDB will find all solutions that include a
`person` entity that has a `full-name` attribute of `Masako Holley` and has any email.

What if there is no `person` entity with this particular name in a database? Then a set of zero solutions (answers)
will be returned, regardless of the emails.

What if there is one `person` with the `full-name` attribute like that, but it has two `email` attributes?
Then TypeDB will find two solutions/answers. And every answer will include that one `person` entity and one of the
emails.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A `match` clause returns all possible <<_solutions, solutions>> (combinations of variables values that make pattern a
`true` statement), including all possible permutations. It's very important to understand how `match` clause matches
patterns. Especially if it's used as a part of an insert or delete query, because the `insert` or `delete` clause in
these will be executed once for every matched result from `match` clause used.

For example, we match for all instances of *two* different types without any additional constraints.
Let's say one of the types has **2** instances and the other one has **10** instances. Then `match` clause returns
all matched combinations including all permutations: **20 matched results** in total.

[#_variables]
== Variables

There are two types of variables:

[#_concept_variable]
* Concept variable -- used *by default* in most queries. Reference a concept (either an instance of data or a type).
[#_value_variable]
* Value variable -- used only in computation, like <<_arithmetic_operations,arithmetic operations>>
  and other <<_built_in_functions,built-in functions>>, requiring direct operation on values.

A concept variable starts with dollar sign `$` followed by variable label (for example, `$x`) and reference exactly
one concept (type or data) per every answer (solution) found for a pattern. See <<_example>> below.

A value variable starts with question mark `?` followed by variable label (for example, `?x`) and reference exactly
one value per every answer (solution) found for a pattern. See <<_value_variables>> below.

=== Comparison operators

The following operators are supported for comparing attribute values: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `+<=+`.

[WARNING]
====
In TypeDB version `2.18.0` the usage of `=` sign as a comparison operator was *deprecated* as it is being used now
to assign values to value variables.

We recommend using `==` for comparison instead.

The old syntax, for example:

[,typeql]
----
$p = $u;
----

will be supported for backwards compatibility for a limited time (if it's used with concept variable on the left from
the `=` sign).

It will be removed from the TypeQL syntax in later versions of TypeDB.
====

[#_value_variables]
=== Value variables

Additionally, to the default concept xref:read.adoc#_variables[variables], that address concepts inside a
TypeDB database, there is a special type of variables, used only for xref:match.adoc#_computation[computation].

They are called Value variables.

Instead of dollar sign (e.g., `$p`) value variables use question mark (e.g., `?x`) preceding the variable label.

Instead of concepts, value variables represent exact value in a pattern.
To set value variable with some value we can use `=` sign: with value variable on the left from it and on the right
side -- we shall have an <<_expression,expression>>. Value variables are never materialised permanently, and only used
within the scope of a particular query or rule. To persist the value of a value variable we can use an attribute type
with a matching value type. Value variables can be one of the following value types (the same as value types for
attributes):

* `long`,
* `double`,
* `boolean`,
* `string`,
* `datetime`.

[#_expression]
*Expression* describes the computation of the value for value variable. It contains any combination of the following
elements:

* constant, set in a query (e.g., `?x = 4`),
* value of a concept variable (it should be an attribute to have a value) or value variable, bound in the query,
* <<_arithmetic_operations,arithmetic operation>>,
* other <<_built_in_functions,built-in function>>.

.See expression example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
match
  $s isa size-kb;
  ?x = round($s/2) + 1;
----
====

The query above will find all instances of data for the `size-kb` attribute type for a concept variable `$s`.
For a value variable `?x` we divide value of the instance of attribute in `$s` by a constant value `2`, rounding it,
and add 1 to the result. Hence, every result for this query consists of `$s` and `?x`:

* `$s` equals to a value of an attribute of `size-kb` type,
* `?x` equals the result of computation we described in the query, that depends on value of the attribute.

[#_computation]
=== Computation

[#_arithmetic_operations]
==== Arithmetic operations

The following keywords can be used for arithmetic operations between value variables, values of attributes, that are
stored in concept variables, or constants:

1. `()` -- parentheses. See <<#_using_parentheses,example>>.
2. `^` -- exponentiation (power). See <<#_using_exponentiation,example>>.
3. `*` -- multiplication. See <<#_using_multiplication,example>>.
4. `/` -- division. See <<#_using_division,example>>.
5. `%` -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo[modulo,window=_blank]. Returns the remainder of a division.
   See <<#_using_modulo,example>>.
6. `+` -- addition. See <<#_using_addition,example>>.
7. `-` -- subtraction. See <<#_using_subtraction,example>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The above list is sorted by the order in which those operations applied.
====

.See example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
?mb = $s/1024;
?mb > 1;
----
====

In the example above we designed a pattern to find instances of data for `file` type owning `size-kb` attribute
with value, that after dividing it by 1024 (to get megabytes out of kilobytes), is bigger than 1.

[#_built_in_functions]
==== Built-in functions

Built-in functions usually invoked with adjacent parentheses that contain arguments to apply function on. Those
arguments, separated by a comma as a separator. The following built-in functions are available in TypeDB:

* `min` -- found minimum of the arguments. See <<#_using_minimum_function,example>>.
* `max` -- found maximum of the arguments. See <<#_using_maximum_function,example>>.
* `floor` -- floor function (rounding down). See <<#_using_floor_function,example>>.
* `ceil` -- ceiling function (rounding up). See <<#_using_ceiling_function,example>>.
* `round` -- default rounding function. See <<#_using_rounding_function,example>>.
* `abs` -- modulus (or absolute value) function. See <<#_using_absolute_value_function,example>>.

== Combining statements

image::pattern-structure.png[Combining statements]
//#todo Fix the image - Types of patterns

By arranging statements together, we can express more complex pattern scenarios and their corresponding data.

* *Statement*: Simplest possible arrangement -- a single basic building block as <<_patterns_overview,explained above>>.
* *Conjunction* (logical `AND`): A set of statements, where to satisfy a match, all statements must be true.
We use conjunctions by default just by separating the partaking statements with semicolons `;`.
* *Disjunction* (logical `OR`): A set of statements, where to satisfy a match, at least one statement must be matched.
We form disjunctions by enclosing the partaking statements within curly braces `{}` and joining them together with the
keyword `or`.
* *Negation* (logical negation): A statement that explicitly defines conditions that must *not* to be met. We form
negations by defining the conditions *not* to be met in curly brackets of a `not {};` block.

See the <<_complex_example,complex example>> below.
