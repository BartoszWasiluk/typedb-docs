== Overview

A TypeDB Client is any software that can connect to a TypeDB.
It is meant to be used for the purpose of managing databases and performing operations (querying) with a
database schema and data on the TypeDB server.

TypeDB uses its own https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Client RPC] protocol via `gRPC` interface
to accept connections from Clients. To connect we can use xref:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio],
xref:console.adoc[TypeDB Console], or we can build our own application (Client).

A TypeDB Client uses `gRPC` to connect with a TypeDB server and provides more user-friendly interface: API, GUI or CLI.

To build an application capable of connecting to TypeDB via *TypeDB Client RPC* protocol we can use one of the existing
libraries implementing it, called <<_typedb_drivers,TypeDB Drivers>>, or we can implement it ourselves as a
xref:new-driver.adoc[new driver].

  ** xref:python/python-overview.adoc[Python]
  ** xref:node-js/node-js-overview.adoc[Node.js]
  ** Rust [Under development]

If there is no suitable client in the list, check the xref:other-languages.adoc[Community drivers],
or consider xref:new-driver.adoc[creating a new client].

There is also a community driven Jupyter notebook plugin to work with TypeDB:
https://pypi.org/project/typedb-jupyter/[TypeDB Jupyter connector].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both TypeDB Drivers and applications built with them can be addressed as TypeDB Clients. But the implementation of the
TypeDB Client RPC protocol is in the TypeDB Driver.

For example, both TypeDB Studio and TypeDB Console are built with TypeDB Java Driver inside.
====

[WARNING]
====
All TypeDB Clients are subjects to xref:typedb::02-dev/connect.adoc#_protocol_version[protocol version control].
TypeDB Client of an incompatible version won't be able to establish a connection to a TypeDB server.
====

== Standalone applications

To work with TypeDB databases we can use one of the standalone software tools developed by Vaticle:

. xref:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] -- IDE with GUI and TypeQL syntax highlighting.
. xref:console.adoc[TypeDB Console] -- powerful CLI tool, most useful for automation.

Both tools are complete software products that can be used to connect to TypeDB and interact with it. They take care
of connection, session and transaction management, automate query sending and process the query response.

== TypeDB Drivers

A TypeDB Driver, is a library that implements https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Client RPC]
protocol and provides TypeDB Driver API.

A TypeDB Driver can be used to connect to a TypeDB server. If we are building an application that uses a TypeDB database,
we would need a TypeDB driver at our application layer to handle the database operations.
TypeDB Drivers are available for some of the most popular programming languages.

The following TypeDB Drivers are officially supported and actively maintained by the Vaticle. They
usually support latest TypeDB features and receive continuous bug fixes and improvements.

* xref:java/java-overview.adoc[Java]
* xref:node-js/node-js-overview.adoc[Node.js]
* xref:python/python-overview.adoc[Python]
* Rust (https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-client-rust[Under development])

We also have some community projects for xref:other-languages.adoc[other Languages] and provide support for
creating a xref:new-driver.adoc[new client].

=== Architecture of a TypeDB Driver

All TypeDB Drivers share a common architecture. A TypeDB Drivers needs a `gRPC` client library to communicate with
the server.

A TypeDB Client provides a human or machine interface and interacts with TypeDB server, but also it performs query
validation, local processing, load-balancing (TypeDB Cloud only) and authentication (TypeDB Cloud only).

The following schema is the dependency graph of a typical TypeDB Client.

//#todo Update Cluster to be Enterprise
//#todo Redraw in new design

Simply put, the main components of any TypeDB Client are the classes
and methods to establish a connection to a TypeDB database, execute queries and process responses.

TypeDB Clients in the form of standalone applications usually take care of internal processes and provide a
user-friendly interface for user (graphical or command-line).

Language specific libraries (or TypeDB Drivers) provide more direct access to the classes and methods via
TypeDB Driver API:

* xref:java/java-api-ref.adoc[Java Driver API reference],
* xref:python/python-api-ref.adoc[Python Driver API reference],
* xref:node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc[Node.js Driver API reference].
