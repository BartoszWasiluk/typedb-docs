== Overview

A TypeDB Client is any software that can connect to a TypeDB.

All TypeDB Clients use https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Client RPC,window=_blank] protocol based on
`gRPC` framework under the hood to communicate with a TypeDB server and provide more user-friendly interface:
API, GUI, or CLI.

To build a custom application capable of connecting to TypeDB via *TypeDB Client RPC* protocol we can use one of the
existing libraries implementing it, called <<_typedb_drivers,TypeDB Drivers>>, or we can implement it ourselves as a
xref:new-driver.adoc[new driver].

Here is a list of existing *TypeDB Clients*:

* xref:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio]
* xref:console.adoc[TypeDB Console]
* <<_typedb_drivers,TypeDB Drivers>> -- libraries to connect to a TypeDB server with an application. There are:
  ** xref:java/java-overview.adoc[Java]
  ** xref:python/python-overview.adoc[Python]
  ** xref:node-js/node-js-overview.adoc[Node.js]
  ** Rust (https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-client-rust[Under development,window=_blank])

If there is no suitable client in the list, check the xref:other-languages.adoc[Community drivers],
or consider xref:new-driver.adoc[creating a new client].

There is also a community driven Jupyter notebook plugin to work with TypeDB:
https://pypi.org/project/typedb-jupyter/[TypeDB Jupyter connector,window=_blank].

[NOTE]
====
Both TypeDB Drivers and applications built with them can be addressed as TypeDB Clients.

For example, both TypeDB Studio and TypeDB Console are built with TypeDB Java Driver inside.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
All TypeDB Clients validate compatibility with the TypeDB server when establishing a connection.
This is done using xref:typedb::dev/connect.adoc#_protocol_version[protocol versioning], and
ensures that the Client can't send or receive unexpected data from the server.
====

== Standalone applications

To work with TypeDB databases we can use one of the standalone software tools developed by Vaticle:

. xref:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] -- IDE with GUI and TypeQL syntax highlighting.
. xref:console.adoc[TypeDB Console] -- powerful CLI tool, often used for automation.

Both tools are complete software products that can be used to connect to TypeDB and interact with it. They manage
connections, sessions and transactions, as well as submitting queries and reading back the responses.

== TypeDB Drivers

A TypeDB Driver is a library that implements https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Client RPC,window=_blank]
protocol and provides <<_driver_api,TypeDB Driver API>>. TypeDB Drivers are available for some of the most popular
programming languages, allowing you to build applications that connect to a TypeDB database easily.

The following TypeDB Drivers are officially supported and actively maintained by the Vaticle. They
support latest TypeDB features and receive continuous bug fixes and improvements.

* xref:java/java-overview.adoc[Java]
* xref:node-js/node-js-overview.adoc[Node.js]
* xref:python/python-overview.adoc[Python]
* Rust (https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-client-rust[Under development,window=_blank])

We also have some community projects for xref:other-languages.adoc[other languages] and provide support for
creating a xref:new-driver.adoc[new driver].

=== Architecture of a TypeDB Driver

All TypeDB Drivers share a common architecture and capabilities. The core components have to do with providing a human
or machine interface, opening and managing connections, sessions, and transactions, as well as validating and
submitting queries, processing responses, load-balancing (TypeDB Enterprise & TypeDB Cloud only), and authentication
(TypeDB Enterprise & TypeDB Cloud only).

The following schema is the dependency graph of a typical TypeDB Client.

image::client-structure.png[Structure of a TypeDB Client]

Simply put, the main components of any TypeDB Client are the classes
and methods to establish a connection to a TypeDB database, execute queries and process responses.

TypeDB Clients in the form of standalone applications usually take care of internal processes and provide a
user-friendly interface for user (graphical or command-line).

[#_driver_api]
Language specific libraries (or TypeDB Drivers) provide more direct access to the classes and methods via
TypeDB Driver API:

* xref:java/java-api-ref.adoc[Java Driver API reference],
* xref:python/python-api-ref.adoc[Python Driver API reference],
* xref:node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc[Node.js Driver API reference].
