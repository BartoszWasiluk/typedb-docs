== Where to go from here?

For a bird's-eye view of TypeDB's features, see the xref:introduction.adoc[] page.

For a more practical approach, xref:installation.adoc[install] a TypeDB server and use our xref:quickstart.adoc[] to
set up a TypeDB environment and further explore its capabilities.

After setting up a working TypeDB environment, we recommend reading the following sections:

* *Fundamentals* -- essential knowledge about TypeDB
* *Development* -- detailed documentation of the TypeDB development workflow
* *Operations* -- instructions for setting up a production environment
* *Tutorials* -- including how-to guides and the xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[]

There are separate documentation sections for:

* xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients]
* xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL]
