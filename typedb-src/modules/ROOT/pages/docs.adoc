== Thinking in TypeQL and TypeDB

// #todo Change the link to TypeQL -

The backbone of any TypeDB database is the representation of our domain: the xref:02-dev/schema.adoc[schema].
A TypeDB schema is the blueprint of a TypeDB database. Using TypeQL language, we
define a schema to model a domain true to nature. The schema is made up of a set of types and rules, which harness
object-oriented principles and logical deduction.

Types defined in a schema are all subtypes of the following basic ones:

* Entities. Representing self-sufficient objects.
* Relations. Representing n-ary relationships.
* Attributes. Representing properties with a value: numeric, text string, boolean, or date&time.

[NOTE]
====
These terms correspond to the components of an Entity-Relation-Attribute model, an extension of the well-known
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model[ER model], in which attributes (properties) also
treated as first-class citizens.
====

Rules defined in a schema represent deductive logic. They are defined as condition (when clause) and conclusion
(then clause). Read queries with inference option enabled can generate insights based on the deductive logic
described with rules. Those insights are transaction bound and are not persisted.
